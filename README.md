Repository for team project  under GDSC IIIT Surat.

We are trying to provide a solution for vendors and stall owners who wish to maintain a record of GST invoices and
provide customers a legitimate invoice.

We understand that vendors and stall owners don't have the privilege to own and maintain heavy equipment like a Desktop computer
So sticking to the problem statement we put our content in a Mobile Webview and provided local storage for the Bills to decrease 
hassle for our clients.(छोटे व्यवसायी)

As vendors are not known to be very tech-savvy.
We provide an easy to use interface. Rather than using forms to type out the amounts, we use large buttons
with image icons to make the usage obvious.

With the skills that we had and the time provided, we chose Web based native application as our implementation method.

Given that the UI of our application is web based, It is easier to port our application for other operating systems.
We can just create containers for the respective.
